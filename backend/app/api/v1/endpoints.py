üìã Analysis Results:
‚úÖ Document successfully processed and analyzed
‚úÖ Relevant information extracted using NLP techniques
‚úÖ Context-aware response generated

üìñ Key Findings:
‚Ä¢ This is a demonstration of the HackRx 6.0 Query Retrieval System
‚Ä¢ The system is optimized for Render's free hosting tier
‚Ä¢ Full document processing and vector search capabilities are available
‚Ä¢ Real-time query processing with intelligent responses

üéØ System Features Demonstrated:
- Document upload and parsing
- Natural language query processing  
- Intelligent response generation
- Memory-optimized architecture for cloud deployment

üí° Note: This is a demo response optimized for free hosting. 
In production, this would include actual document analysis and vector search results.
